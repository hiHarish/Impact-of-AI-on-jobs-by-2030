* **Medium-risk roles show a better balance between Tech Growth Factor and Automation Probability**, signaling stronger sustainability.
* **AI exposure does not always directly indicate automation**, proving that risk is profession-dependent.
* Jobs with **higher skill mix variance show comparatively lower AI risk score**, meaning adaptability matters more than education tags.
* **Tech Growth Factor increases slower than AI exposure**, indicating faster AI penetration than job evolution.
